Overview:

This project explores the implementation of K-Means clustering on the Online Retail Store dataset, aiming to segment customers based on purchasing behavior.
Customer segmentation allows businesses to understand groups of customers and tailor strategies for enhanced customer satisfaction and increased revenue.

Features:-
- Data Preprocessing:- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features and scaling numeric data.
- Extracting meaningful features, such as total purchase amount and transaction frequency.

 Clustering Algorithm:-
- Applying K-Means to group customers based on key metrics such as transaction history, spending patterns, and recency of purchase.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Curve.

Visualization:-
- Presenting clusters with visual tools like scatter plots and heatmaps to understand customer groups better.

Dependencies:-
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
