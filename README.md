Overview:

This project explores the implementation of K-Means clustering.

Features:-
- Data Preprocessing:- Handling missing values.
- Encoding categorical features and scaling numeric data.
- Extracting meaningful features, such as total purchase amount and transaction frequency.

 Clustering Algorithm:-
- Applying K-Means to group customers based on key metrics such as transaction history, spending patterns, and recency of purchase.
- Determining the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Curve.

Visualization:-
- Presenting clusters with visual tools like scatter plots and heatmaps to understand customer groups better.

Dependencies:-
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (optional)
